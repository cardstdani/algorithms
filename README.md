## Introduction
Welcome to the Algorithms repository! Here, you'll find a collection of algorithms implemented in various programming languages. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand fundamental algorithms or an experienced developer seeking efficient implementations, this repository aims to provide clear and concise code along with detailed explanations.

## Algorithms
This section categorizes algorithms based on their functionality:

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementations of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Algorithms for searching elements within data structures including Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Algorithms for traversing and analyzing graphs like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Solutions to optimization problems using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Miscellaneous:** Other algorithms that don't fit into the above categories.

## Usage
Each algorithm comes with its own documentation and example code, making it easy to understand and use. Simply navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file.

## Who are we?
Born on UVa (Spain) in 2024, we are a group of students passionate about algorithms, data structures and competitive programing on the seek of new knowledge and fun.  
We also try to attend to every coding competitions we can (like CCC, Ada-Byron, ...), for which we organize practice meetings.  
We are ussed to work with python, but on our way to migrate to java/c++ for better performance ðŸ‘·.
